# codingquiz

I obtained several premade template ideas for the coding quiz

consisting of a homepage, quiz page, score save page and leaderboards page

javascript is quite challenging where it confuses me in which variables to name

game.js has alot of scripts describing the effects of each of the funtions.
 
functions that:

start the game and create an initial value for all items such as the score, time, questions and etc.

a function that gets a new value

a function for a countdown timer that doesnt get recognized by the system strangely

a function that removes a question by splicing out of the object

a funtion that alters the score when a certain answer is selected.

other funtions.

there is probably an error when defining several max score values in the javascript in regards to the
use of ${}. will need further explanation with TA.
